/*Control flow statements
continue: Can only be used inside of a loop, continue says go to the next iteration of the list.
break: Break appears in switch statements, loops and means just exit the loop. Break only executes if the if statement is true.
return: return will get out of the function entirly. if your function is an int it must return a value you can only use return without a value on void fucntions. 
Note to self learn control flow and make a good example.
