/*Const keyword
Constants allow our code to look cleaner and prevent variable values being modified.
A constant pointer depends on where youve placed the keyword when declaring the new pointer for example if the keyword is at the beginning it will make the value
it points too a constant and the opposite would only allow you to change the address of the pointer.
*/

/*Mutable keyword
Marking a class member as mutable means const methods inside that class can modify that memeber declared as mutable.
A really naive example, imagine if I only give non-const handles to friends, enemies get a const handle. Friends can modify, enemies cannot.
Note too self make an example.
