(>) Greater than
(<=) Less than or equal to
(>=) Greater than or equal to

(+) Addition
(-) Subtraction

(/) Division
(%) Modulus

(--x;) Decrement, reduce by one the value stored in a variable. 
They are equivalent to +=1 and to -=1, respectively.
(++x;) Increment, a peculiarity of this operator is that it can be used both as a prefix and as a suffix. 
That means that it can be written either before the variable name (++x) or after it (x++). 
Although in simple expressions like x++ or ++x, both have exactly the same meaning; in other 
expressions in which the result of the increment or decrement operation is evaluated, they may 
have an important difference in their meaning: In the case that the increase operator is used as 
a prefix (++x) of the value, the expression evaluates to the final value of x, once it is 
already increased. On the other hand, in case that it is used as a suffix (x++), the value 
is also increased, but the expression evaluates to the value that x had before being increased.
(x+=1;) 
(x=x+1;)

(!) Not
(&&) And, if the left-hand side expression is false, the combined result is 
false (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated).
(||) Or, if the left-hand side expression is true, the combined result is 
true (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated).

(?) Ternary operator, The conditional operator evaluates an expression, returning one 
value if that expression evaluates to true, and a different one if the expression evaluates as false. 
Its syntax is: condition ? result1 : result2

(,) Comma operator, is used to separate two or more expressions that are included where only one 
expression is expected. When the set of expressions has to be evaluated for a value, only 
the right-most expression is considered.

(&) AND, Bitwise AND
(|) OR,	Bitwise inclusive OR
(^) XOR, Bitwise exclusive OR
(~) NOT, Unary complement (bit inversion)
(<<) SHL, Shift bits left
(>>) SHR, Shift bits right
