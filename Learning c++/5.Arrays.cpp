/*Arrays
Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted.
Arrays in c++ always start at index position 0. The first value is always index position zero.
Writing values outside of the array will cause a memory access violation.
Arrays are good for, for loops.
Arrays store data contiguously.
An array is an integer pointer to that block of memory which contains our data
Watch the array video.
Their size must be a compile-time constant unless they are allocated dynamically.
