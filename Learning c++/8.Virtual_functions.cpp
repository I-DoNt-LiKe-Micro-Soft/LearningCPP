/*Virtual functions
Virtual functions allow us to overwite methods in subclasses.
Virtual functions introduce something called dynamic dispatch which compilers typically implement via a V table which is a table containing mapping for all our virtual 
functions except our base class. This is used so we can correctly map them to the overwitten function at runtime.
You have to mark functions as virutal.
